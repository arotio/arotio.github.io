<div>You should really just make a starter right now. It's flour and Budweiser (or water if you're short on the beer). It takes 60 seconds. Make it, you won't regret it.</div>

<h3><b>Story</b> </h3>
 <div>
    <p><img src="http://rotio.net/rotiofood/2014-07-13/buddy_top.jpg"/><br/>I had a pretty incredible group of roommates throughout my time in Mather House at Harvard. There were six constants - the six football guys who grudgingly pulled each other out of bed every morning at 5:30 to make it down to lift on time to face the wrath of Fitz/Frazer/Mullen - and a few rotating roommates throughout the years. We hosted a great guy named Sheng Pan who came to us from a small fishing village in China (population 13MM people is apparently small over there). Marc (who now writes for the New Yorker) lived with us for a year after coming back from touring with The Hive, The Strokes, and Kings of Leon. Sid is now writing back in his home country of India and Nicolai is visiting with him as we speak. There were many others who will undoubtedly pop up in future stories but today I want to talk about Tim. Tim and I met one night during an event when we were trying to become members of the Fox Club - we had been drinking.. heavily.. and found ourselves the last ones in the club, bonding over story after story. We weren't even yet inducted into the club and around 2AM, the club president left and asked us to lock up and turn the lights off when we were ready to leave. Tim and I knew we had both found a new great friend and, a year later, he moved in and joined the beer drinking machine in our room on the 4th floor of Mather. <br/><br/>

I remember one time, we were whooping it up about America and how amazing the USA is - per usual - when Tim blurted out, "My family has a bakery older than your country!" Well... Tim's from Germany and this statement turned out to be true so it stopped us in our tracks for a minute. I had a mixture of "wow, that's crazy!" and "why have you never brought us bread!?" I had already enjoyed making bread and that moment took my interest to the next level. I had to find out what the secrets to bread were. From studying <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0684800012/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0684800012&linkCode=as2&tag=rotiofood-20&linkId=KBKSE6W727M7YN5W">McGee's Book</a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=rotiofood-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0684800012" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> in our Science and Cooking course, to talking to breadmakers, to scouring the internet, it became clear that I needed a sourdough starter (or a "mother"). Starters are simple, water and a starch. You leave them out and they recruit wild yeast from the surrounding air. Take care of a starter and feed it regularly and you'll develop a rich sourdough flavor and a nice mini-habitat filled with yeast to supply all of your breadmaking (and many other cooking) needs. A starter is hardy, they will last a very long time - often passed down for generations. <br/><br/>

Like I said, most "mothers" begin with just water and flour. Sometimes random juices and scraps are added from the counter to maintain them. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/LauraVitalesKitchen">Laura Vitale from Laura in the Kitchen</a> told me that her grandmother would throw in the scraps from pizza dough and pineapple juice occasionally to keep hers going. I decided my starter would have a very strict diet. I started it back in January 2014 and the only two things it's ever been fed are Budweiser and bread flour. Buddy has great willpower and is very good at sticking to his diet.

<h3><b>Story</b> </h3>
 <div>
    <p><img src="http://rotio.net/rotiofood/2014-06-19/knot.gif"/><br/>Ah the humble garlic knot. These are a sure-to-find on the menu of any good pizza place. The concept is simple and they're simple to make once you have the pizza dough. You start with the dough, tie a knot, bake it, toss it in some garlic, butter, oil, and salt - and that's it, you're done... Bread, butter, and garlic -- what else do you need. I never started ordering garlic knots regularly until sophomore year of college. We found a pizza place in Harvard Square that served $5 pitchers of beer, which, for Cambridge, was one hell of a deal. The roommates and I partook often. The caveat was that you had to order food to be able to drink. No one wanted to spend 15 bucks on a pie so we defaulted to the cheapest item on the menu: garlic knots. Tasting these brought me right back to that little "Crazy Dough's" restaurant, up the escalator, in "The Garage."<br/><br/><img src="http://rotio.net/rotiofood/2014-06-19/final_wb.jpg"/></p>

      1. Combine water, buddy, oil, and yeast in a large bowl. Add salt. Slowly alternate adding flour and mixing until dough forms a ball. Continue adding flour until you have formed a ball that is soft but not sticky. Turn out onto floured board and knead with floured hands for 10 minutes (or use dough hook on machine at lowest setting for 5 minutes).<br />
      2. Coat dough in olive oil, place in bowl, cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight. <br />
      3. Remove dough from fridge 1 hour before you are ready to begin cooking.<br />
      4. Place stone on top rack and preheat oven to broil (also one hour before cook time). <br />
      5. Gently stretch dough by hand into a the best pizza you can make, use as much flour as you need (mine came out like an ugly egg).<br />
      6. Using a pizza cutter or floured sharp knife, cut 4in by 2in strips or as close to those measurements as possible.<br />
      7. Flour a strip and stretch to about 8 inches. Tie a knot in dough (see gif below for demo). Tuck ends back into knot. Repeat for all strips<br />
      8. Place all sauce ingredients into microwave safe bowl, cover and microwave for 2-3 minutes.<br />
      9. Place knots on stone. Check in 3 minutes. If golden brown, remove from oven - if not, check again every minute until they are.<br />
      10. Toss with garlic butter and enjoy.<br /><br/>
      Note: If you have a favorite pizza dough, you can definitely start with that to save yourself some time. I encourage you to try the homemade sourdough, though - it is worth the time investment.<br />

<h3><b>Story</b> </h3>
 <div>
    <p><img src="http://rotio.net/rotiofood/2014-06-11/market.jpg"/><br/>Yesterday, I went to check out a local farmer's market. It was a great experience where the people who grew/prepared/slaughtered the wares were actually standing there to explain to you exactly what you were getting and every step of the process. I was inspired to find some ingredients for our second sourdough pie. I found garlic shoots, which I had never worked with before, herbs de provence goat cheese, and white eggplant. I combined these with some bacon and chili oil to make a pretty tasty, if unconventional, sourdough pie.</p>

<h3><b>Pairing - The Ogden</b> </h3> 
    <div>
    <img src="http://rotio.net/rotiofood/2014-06-11/ogden.jpg">
    <br/>
    We paired this pie with The Ogden from Goose Island. The Ogden is a bold, sweet, malty Tripel with a fresh black currant, citrusy aroma of Brewers Gold and Citra hops. The sweetness of the malt is very nice to cut through the spicy garlic shoots and tangy goat cheese. The aromatic yet muted-spice hop combination pick up and amplify the chili oil but also provide freshness to the dish. Oh and the Ogden is 9% and lightly carbonated. It will give you a nice buzz.. and if not careful it will put you to bed. Enjoy as often as responsibly possible. It definitely just landed itself in my top 5...

<h3><b>Story</b> </h3>
 <div>
    <p>We love pizza. We make it quite a bit. In our kitchen I haven't been able to nail a pizza with really good lift on the crust because we don't have a broiler in our gas oven... or so I thought! Katie pointed out that our broiler was beneath the oven, which is, apparently, pretty conventional but something I'd never had before. Tonight I threw the stone in there, pulled out some Buddy sourdough we had working and tried our classic Margherita. In honor of the World Cup starting today and the Budweiser sourdough crust, we paired this one with a Budweiser in the World Cup Aluminum Bottle. This pairing was on point.</p>

      6. Transfer pie to stone and cook for 4-5 minutes or until crust is crisp. <br />

<h3><b>Pairing - Budweiser</b> </h3> 
    <div>
    <img src="http://rotio.net/rotiofood/2014-06-11/budweiser.jpg">
    <br/>
    We paired this pie with a Budweiser. Budweiser's biscuit note picks up the breadiness of the sourdough. The balanced maltiness amplifies the sweetness of the San Marzano tomatoes. Budweiser's crisp, clean finish (from using rice as an adjunct) helps cut the creaminess of the fresh mozz. Really nice combination and it is very cool to taste a hint of the Budweiser in the sourdough -- since that is all that Buddy has been drinking since January -- and then get the full punch of it in the glass.

<h3><b>Story</b> </h3>
 <div>
    <p>We couldn't decide between sweet or salty this morning so we decided to go with both. We made a quick sourdough pasta, filled them with maple onions and ricotta, and topped with bacon and a runny egg. It was very satisfying. The salted maple-caramelized onions were delicious -- we will probably end up making a large batch of these and keeping them in a jar in the fridge for everything from cheese plates to burgers. This one takes some time (and some dishes) but it was a nice splurge for a Sunday. Enjoy!</p>

  <br /><h4>Directions:</h4>
    
    <div itemprop="recipeInstructions">
      1. Preheat oven to 400 F. Fill large pot half way up with water, cover and start on high heat.<br />
      2. Combine water and sourdough starter (follow regular pasta recipe if no sourdough starter available).<br />
      3. Dump flour on board and create well in center. Dump liquid mixture into well. Combine until slightly tacky to the touch. Cover with damp towel and allow to rest on board while you continue.<br />
      4. Heat evoo in medium skillet on medium low heat, add onions and salt, cooking slowly until they are very tender and brown. Add maple syrup and cook for 5 more minutes. Remove from heat and combine with ricotta.<br />
      5. Line pan with foil, lay bacon out on pan in a single layer. Place in preheated oven for 15 minutes or until desired doneness is achieved. <br />
      6. Roll dough thinly (1/8") with rolling pin or pasta roller, be sure to flour as needed and keep your board floured to avoid sticking. Cut pasta sheet into 3" (diameter) circles. I got about 10. <br />
      7. Place quarter sized drop of filling in center of pasta. Fold over into half moon carefully making sure edge is sealed (use a bit of water if necessary). Be careful not to rip your pasta. Fold corners of half moon to meet and press together tightly to ensure they stay together. Plenty of great videos out there to assist if you do a quick search for homemade tortellini. <br />
      8. Heavily salt boiling water. Boil pasta for 4 minutes. When you drop pasta begin cooking two eggs in greased pan on medium heat. <br />
      9. Carefully drain pasta, place in bowl, top with egg and crumbled bacon. Open Budweiser. Eat.<br/>
