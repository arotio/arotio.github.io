<h4>Story</b> </h4>
 <div>
	<p>
	  There is something special about a cheese plate. At first glance, it can be perceived as a food of the upper crust: fine cheeses, charcuterie, and condiments served with rustic bread or "authentic artisinal" crackers (what does that even mean?) and arranged with the precision of a Floris van Dyck still life. The cheese plate is a versatile medium, a blank canvas that you can spread with whatever cured, aged, preserved, ancient-grained, and double-creamed paints of your choosing.
<br/><br/>
But let's be honest for a bit and cut through all the Edam nonsense. Let's appreciate the cheese plate for exactly what it is: it's sandwich guts thrown around on a plate that you get to dig into with your hands, eat for hours, and try every little combination your heart desires. It's like going to your favorite deli, getting behind the counter, putting your hands in everything, making 15 sandwiches, and then taking just one bite out of each one of them. It's freaking awesome.

<br/><br/>
A sandwich, by nature, needs two components: filling and a vehicle for those fillings. On a cheese plate, the vehicle tends to be a nice crusty bread or crackers. We were craving one of these make-your-own-sandwich platters but - after a week of honeymooning - our apartment was crackerless and breadless. So after a few quick searches for a Wheat Thins clone and some experimentation in the kitchen, we had a pretty solid batch of crackers on our hands.
<br/><br/>
Oh and for anyone who was at our wedding, this recipe uses the Rotio/Spice mix we gave out as favors so here's another use for you.

  <br /><u><h5>Directions</h5></u>
	<div itemprop="recipeInstructions">
		1. Preheat oven to 400 and grease large cookie sheet.<br/>
		2. Mix all dry ingredients.<br/>
		3. Cut butter into dry ingredients, if using a food processor, pulse until the mixture looks like coarse wet sand.<br/>
		4. While machine is running or while still mixing, add coconut oil and water until mixture comes together into a ball.<br/>
		5. Turn out dough onto well floured surface and roll until paper thin. It works best to roll a third of the dough at a time unless you have a huge surface to roll on.<br/>
		6. Using pizza cutter or knife, cut into cracker sized squares and place on cookie sheet.<br/>
		7. Bake 5-10 minutes, until golden brown. Keep a close eye on them!<br/>
